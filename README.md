This is Pong-clone served as more "advanced" project that introduced me to framerate regulation,collision detection and basic menu and score implementation.

Windows users will have to wait for binaries in the future.

Linux users should first install the required dependencies by executing the following command :

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

The game supports two players versus and a "vs cpu mode" will be implemented in the future.

A match ends when a player scores 3 goals.

Have fun.
